**Please read:**

By default, the debug adapter from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug is now used for Chrome debugging in VS Code. 

Please file your issue at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/issues

This repo should only be used for high-severity issues involving the old Chrome debugger (when the `debug.javascript.usePreview` setting is disabled).
